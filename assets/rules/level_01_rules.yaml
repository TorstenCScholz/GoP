# Example rules for level_01
# This demonstrates the rules system MVP

rules:
  # Example: Switch toggle door (when switch with id "switch_1" is triggered)
  # Note: This is an example - actual switch IDs depend on level data
  # - id: switch_toggle_door
  #   when:
  #     event: EnterRegion
  #     source: switch_1
  #   actions:
  #     - type: toggle
  #       target: door_1

  # Example: One-time secret door
  # - id: secret_door_once
  #   when:
  #     event: EnterRegion
  #     source: secret_trigger
  #   actions:
  #     - type: activate
  #       target: secret_door
  #   once: true
